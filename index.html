<!-- Introduction to the Social Contract even though probably the only people using this 
site are people that have no life becasue they just do debate -->
<p class="mainText">
	Disclaimer: This page may only be funny to those that compete in Lincoln Douglas 
	value debate where barely a round goes by without someone talking about the social 
	contract as if it were a document that exists in physical space and can be physically signed.
	If you were brought here because of an application to the Berkman Klein Center, welcome!
	If this is funny to you, join the fandom! If not, that's really okay--my sister didn't 
	think it was funny either.
	<br></br>
	While the social contract is,
	in fact, merely theoretical and not an actual document
	authored by Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, you can still sign it!
	<br></br>Add your name on the dotted line below to
	show everyone that you are the best member of society because
	you actually signed the social contract.</p>
